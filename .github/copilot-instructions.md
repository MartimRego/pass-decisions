## 🎯 Assistant Guidelines

### When Helping with Notebook Execution

1. **Memory Considerations**: 
   - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Student has **upgraded RAM** - NO LONGER memory-constrained
   - ❌ **IGNORE** any memory-saving code from Module 1 (chunking, batch loading, Polars migrations)
   - ✅ Can load full datasets into memory at once
   - ✅ Standard pandas operations are fine
   - If encountering old memory workarounds, suggest **removing** them

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Prefer Parquet files over JSON (faster & smaller)
   - Use `load_tracking_full()` function from tracking utilities
   - Full match datasets can be loaded at once without chunking
   - No need for batch processing or memory-conscious iteration

3. **Error Troubleshooting**:
   - Check file paths (use `Path` from `pathlib`)
   - Verify data exists in expected directories
   - Check for missing columns/keys in DataFrames
   - Validate data types (especially `match_id` as int)
   - Look for outdated memory-saving code that may cause issues

4. **Exercise Solutions**:
   - Explain concepts before providing code
   - Follow the course's existing code style
   - Use football-specific terminology correctly
   - Reference course materials when relevant
   - Encourage best practices, not memory hacks

5. **Visualization**:
   - Pitch coordinates: x ∈ [0, 120], y ∈ [0, 80] (meters)
   - Green background for pitch plots
   - Use clear legends and labels
   - Interactive plots (Plotly) when helpful for exploration

### When Debugging

1. **Check Execution Order**: Notebooks must run cells sequentially
2. **Verify Imports**: All required libraries imported at top
3. **Data Availability**: Confirm files exist in specified paths
4. **Schema Changes**: Watch for column name mismatches
5. **Kernel State**: Sometimes requires restart for clean state
6. **Legacy Code**: Watch for outdated memory-optimization code

### Football Analytics Domain Knowledge

- **Tracking Data**: Player/ball positions at ~25 fps
- **Event Data**: Discrete actions (passes, shots, tackles)
- **Frames**: Time-synced snapshots of positions
- **Periods**: Match halves (1, 2, sometimes 3/4 for extra time)
- **Roles**: Tactical positions (GK, DF, MF, FW)
- **Formations**: Player spatial arrangements (e.g., 4-3-3)

### Key Metrics to Understand
- **Defensive Line**: Y-coordinate of backline
- **Compactness**: Team spatial density
- **Pitch Control**: Space dominance probability
- **Playing Styles**: Possession sequences clustered by tactics
- **Role Representations**: Player embeddings by position

## 📝 Exercise Support Protocol

### When Student Asks for Help

1. **Understand Context**:
   - Which module & exercise?
   - What's the error or question?
   - What have they tried?

2. **Diagnosis**:
   - Read relevant notebook cells
   - Check for data/environment issues
   - Identify conceptual vs. technical problems
   - Check for legacy memory-saving code causing issues

3. **Response Strategy**:
   - For **errors**: Debug systematically, check data pipeline
   - For **exercises**: Guide with hints first, then provide solution
   - For **concepts**: Explain football analytics context + ML technique

4. **Code Style**:
   - Match existing notebook formatting
   - Add clear comments
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Include docstrings for functions
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't suggest memory-saving techniques (RAM is no longer limited)
- ❌ Don't load data in chunks/batches unless specifically needed algorithmically
- ❌ Don't assume old Module 1 memory constraints apply
- ❌ Don't suggest Polars migrations for memory reasons
- ❌ Don't suggest Dask for RAM limitations

- ✅ Use football terminology correctly (assist = goal-enabling pass)
- ✅ Visualize intermediate results to aid understanding
- ✅ Reference course documentation when explaining concepts
- ✅ Suggest optimizations that improve clarity and correctness
- ✅ Validate outputs match expected football analytics patterns
- ✅ Use standard pandas/numpy operations (no memory workarounds needed)

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT: Pass Decision Analysis Using MDP Framework

### Project Overview
Applying Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling to analyze short vs. long pass decisions in soccer, inspired by Van Roy et al.'s "Leaving Goals on the Pitch" paper on shooting decisions. Using Premier League 2024 season event data.

### Research Questions
1. In which zones do short progressive passes lead to better goal-scoring chances than long direct balls?
2. What is the probability of scoring after sequences of short passes vs. one long pass from midfield?
3. How would altering pass type policies (e.g., 10-20% more long forward passes in specific zones) affect expected goals scored?
4. What is the quality-quantity trade-off when teams increase pass frequency of certain types?

### Technical Approach

**MDP Components**:
- **State Space**: Full-field grid discretization (22×17 cells = 374 states) + 3 absorbing states (goal, no_goal, loss_possession)
- **Action Space**: 9 actions per state:
  1. `short_forward` (< 15m, progressive)
  2. `short_lateral` (< 15m, horizontal)
  3. `short_backward` (< 15m, retention)
  4. `medium_forward` (15-25m, line-breaking)
  5. `medium_lateral` (15-25m, switch)
  6. `medium_backward` (15-25m, outlet)
  7. `long_forward` (> 25m, direct)
  8. `long_lateral` (> 25m, cross-field)
  9. `shoot`
- **Transition Function**: P(s, a, s') learned from event data with Laplace smoothing
- **Policy**: π(a | s) = probability of selecting action a in state s
- **Reward Function**: R = 1 for goals, 0 otherwise
- **Success Rate Modeling**: Quality-quantity trade-off modeling (Method 3) - when policy changes increase pass frequency, success rates adjust based on pass quality distribution

**Analysis Methods**:
1. **Fundamental Matrix Approach**: Compute expected goals under different policies
2. **Probabilistic Model Checking**: Compare action sequences (optional if time permits)
3. **Counterfactual Policy Analysis**: Evaluate "what-if" scenarios

## 🛠️ Project-Specific Guidelines

### When Working on Final Project

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Use clear section headers in notebook
   - Separate data processing, MDP construction, and analysis
   - Document all assumptions and design choices
   - Include sanity checks and validation steps

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Validate pass classifications (visual spot-checks)
   - Check for edge cases (passes near boundaries, very short/long passes)
   - Handle missing data gracefully
   - Use vectorized operations for efficiency

3. **MDP Construction**:
   - Verify probabilities sum to 1 for each (state, action)
   - Check for numerical stability in matrix operations
   - Use Laplace smoothing (α=1 or 2) consistently
   - Validate transition matrix is well-conditioned

4. **Success Rate Modeling**:
   - Rank passes by quality metric (xT added, or goal-outcome)
   - Compute quality distributions per (state, action)
   - Apply adjustments when policy changes frequency
   - Document assumptions clearly

5. **Analysis & Interpretation**:
   - Connect findings to tactical concepts
   - Compare results to reference paper where applicable
   - Acknowledge limitations and data constraints
   - Provide actionable insights for coaches/analysts

6. **Visualization**:
   - Use mplsoccer for pitch plots
   - Consistent color schemes (diverging for comparisons)
   - Clear legends and annotations
   - Heat maps for spatial patterns

### Football Analytics Context for Project
- **Pass Types**: Short build-up vs. long direct play distinction is tactically meaningful
- **Direction**: Forward passes are risky but progressive; backward passes are safe but not advancing
- **Zones**: Defensive third = safety priority, attacking third = risk-taking acceptable
- **Expected Goals**: Ultimate success metric - all analysis ties back to goal probability
